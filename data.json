When we reincorporated as a Public Benefit Corporation in 2015, we formalized environmental stewardship as part of our legal obligations as a company. We believe it is our responsibility and commitment to invest in green infrastructure, support green commuting methods, and factor environmental impact when choosing vendors. Additionally, we've committed to providing recommendations and resources that help creators make environmentally conscious decisions on tasks, like shipping and packaging, that are common to the use of its services. When Climate Neutral started in 2019 by two Kickstarter funded companies, we were excited to join the effort and commit to being climate neutral immediately. We have also worked with the Environmental Defense Fund to build tools for creators on Kickstarter to make their own environmental commitments. We view our position as a well known brand and as a platform as a powerful lever for leading on climate and sustainability.\nView Sustainability Page",

Our Founder, Ian McNally, has always lived simply and by the ethos to not cause harm to others, especially the planet; his adventure food should be no exception- from this, MUIR Energy was born! From the very beginning our ingredient selection was of highest priority. Ian worked tirelessly to perfect our recipes, as well as partnering with vendors and farmers who paid fair wages, and had transparent farming and sourcing practices. The vetting process was tedious and continues to be monitored as we grow; we are very proud to showcase our vendor relationships in the Transparency section of our website. As a small business we pride ourselves on being fluid and able to enact necessary change, and we recognize that minor changes are not to be overlooked. To date we have evaluated every corner of our operations and made changes in the areas of packaging, shipping protocol, waste diversion, employee transportation, and intentional partnerships. One notable offense that we wanted to address were the 5-gallon buckets that our nut and seed butters were shipped in. Once we used up the nut or seed butter, the 5-gallon bucket had no further use to us. After re-purposing as many of these buckets as we could internally, we shifted our focus to finding them a new home as to not just throw them away. After many calls throughout our network we brainstormed the idea that these buckets could be useful when composting. Our original thought was to distribute these buckets to our customers for personal composting use, however the demand was not as high as we had thought! After a few Google searches we had stumbled upon a local San Diego non-profit called Food2Soil who organize community composting efforts. After making contact with Sarah from Food2Soil, she was thrilled to hear about our excess in 5-gallon buckets as they were in dire need of these exact buckets! Ever since our connection in 2020, MUIR has donated all of our used 5-gallon buckets to Food2Soil to repurpose, diverting dozens of buckets away from landfills and encouraging composting in the Greater San Diego area. It is the unconventional idea, the out-there way of thinking that pushes us to innovate and progress day to day. We are inspired by Mother Earth, our customers and our partners, and strive to serve all with integrity and respect.\nView Sustainability Page",

It got us thinking: if we had less gear, we'd have more room for adventure. What began as a goal to create high-quality, versatile products, quickly turned into a way of life. We wanted to own less and do more. That simple, radical idea changed everything. It was the thread that guided us to our most important decisions. Using certified post-consumer recycled materials and swearing off virgin materials was a no-brainer. To us, there's no better way to own less than making use of what we already have, and there's already plenty of plastic waste. Too much. But it isn't enough. With Nomadix, we've dedicated ourselves to making gear to inspire your next adventure, and that will last for every adventure after. Made with the highest quality materials, it's meticulously designed to replace your separate towels for camping, yoga, beach and travel. Light, packable, versatile, sustainable: some of the many reasons it's the only towel you need. Now you can start your own journey to own less, do more.\nView Sustainability Page",

But it didn't stop there - Lindsey wanted to spread the word about what she discovered and ultimately, make the world a better place. Thus, Nature Supply Co was 'born.'

Our organic line meets the Global Organic Textile Standards and is made out of cotton grown without any harmful chemicals or pesticides. Our non-organic apparel manufacturer recycles or re-purposes all of their waste and they use solar energy to power their buildings. Every item is made to order to prevent overstock and waste. We strive for recyclable, reusable, or biodegradable packaging options wherever possible and are constantly updating our processes. We are proud to have zeroed out our entire carbon footprint by becoming Climate Neutral Certified in 2020. To become officially certified, we have set goals to reduce our carbon footprint (such as sourcing more locally-grown organic cotton, minimizing our waste from faulty items through recycling and upcycling, etc.) and to offset any remaining carbon emissions by purchasing carbon offsets. Our ultimate goal is simple: to be a responsible company that makes products that help combat climate change.\nView Sustainability Page",

This is why we we the first water company to use aluminum bottles and cans, which are the most recycled beverage packaging in the world. While it is abundantly clear that our products offer the best end-of-life prospects out of any other option out there (including rPET and cartons), we wanted to do more. We believe that focusing on end-of-life impact is extremely important \u2014 after all, there's no way to undo the damage that a plastic bottle creates if it reaches the ocean \u2014 but we recognize that the manufacturing and transportation of our products has a big impact too.

Rather, we keep everything in the cloud and with the digitization of all files and documents, we have been able to help save trees, which significantly allows our firm to shine when it comes to minimizing our carbon footprint and emissions. While we are ever vigilant to discover new ways to reduce our carbon footprint, at present we believe that we have achieved the lowest emissions possible for any law firm.

As a firm that focuses on assisting entrepreneurs and growing businesses, we are uniquely positioned to assist many different companies to not only grow their businesses but also to do so in a carbon-conscious way. We will continue to engage with new companies and like-minded businesses to share our carbon-neutral business practices and help educate them on becoming more carbon neutral by bringing the power of sustainable energy to the forefront of their business models. Advocating for the environment, increasing awareness, cutting carbon costs, reducing footprints, and replenishing resources are included as additional aspects of this plan.

    "story": "Sustainability Story\nDebuted in January 2021, we are a New York City- based design collective with a new vision for elevated accessories. Progress is our promise. Releasing one product at a time, we're devoted to conscientious craftsmanship, responsible materials, and design without compromise. Instead of following the standard seasonal schedule, we release one design at a time so we can conduct myriad rounds of prototyping and market testing, ensuring that our end results deliver on both practicality and superior aesthetics. Integral to our approach is transparent construction: all our styles are engineered without the unnecessary plastic fillers that are typically inserted into handbag linings. This approach relies purely on the quality and integrated structure of our raw materials, pushing us to maintain rigorous standards of craftsmanship to achieve unparalleled functionality. Collaboration is what makes our innovative structures possible. By inviting our production partners to engage with us in ideation through production, we are able to track and monitor the social, environmental, and human impact of each bag. Since the beginning of 2021, all our bags have been produced in a carbon-neutral, solar-powered facility in Italy renowned for Venetian craftsmanship. It all starts with the raw materials. For every project, we spend months searching the globe for best-in-class leather and textile partners who are as committed to sustainable, low-impact processes as we are. Our leathers are entirely sourced from food byproducts and 100 percent traceable. They are produced in a scope-C gold-standard tannery certified by the Leather Working Group, of which there are only 13 worldwide. This certification guarantees that from rawhide to finished leather, every step of the process is held to the highest standards of environmental impact. Hemp is one of the strongest natural fibers (four times stronger than cotton), and is ideal for constructing durable accessories to last a lifetime. Our hemp is cultivated with minimal water and chemical intervention, naturally dyed for waterproofing, and grown and finished in a single factory. Our decades-old hemp producer was one of the first in the industry to succeed in organic cultivation and become certified by the Global Organic Textile Standard. And Beyond. We take the details seriously, evaluating the environmental impact of every single ingredient (even our zipper tapes are recycled). We incentivize customers to opt for minimal packaging with a discount, but if they request more extensive packaging, we have created an FSC-certified greyboard box that can be reused for years to come. We source deadstock fabric from our hemp supplier to make our dust cloth, which can also be repurposed as a bandana or table cloth.\nView Sustainability Page",
